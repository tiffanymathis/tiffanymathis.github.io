<body>
   <p>Many brands of ginger beer or ginger ale are overly sweet and/or do not have a strong enough ginger flavor, but Fever Tree Ginger Beer combines strong ginger flavor with just the right amount of sweetness. This combination of strong ginger flavor and light sweetness makes Fever Tree Ginger Beer the best ginger beverage I have found at the supermarket.</p>

          <h2>About Pacific Trails</h2>
          <p>
            Located on a breathtaking stretch of California coastline, Pacific
            Trails Resort was born from a lifelong passion for nature.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm Maggie, the owner and manager of Pacific Trails Resort. I have
            always found solace in the great outdoors--whether hiking through
            towering redwoods, listening to the soothing sound of ocean waves,
            or observing wildlife. I long dreamed of creating a sanctuary where
            guests could simultaneously enjoy nature along with the comforts of
            a luxury resort.
          </p>
          <p>
            Pacific Trails is the fulfillment of that dream. Guests stay in
            yurts which were designed to harmoniously blend with the surrounding
            landscape and which offer stunning ocean views. In addition to our
            thoughtfully designed accommodations, we provide unique outdoor
            experiences that foster a deeper connection to the natural
            environment. Join us for guided hikes and bird watching trips, or
            rent a kayak for an immersive outdoor experience. We can't wait to
            share our coastal paradise with you!

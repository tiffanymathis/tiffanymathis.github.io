            <h3>What is a yurt?</h3>

            <p>
              Our luxury yurts are permanent structures four feet off the
              ground. Each yurt is fully enclosed with canvas walls, a wooden
              floor, and a roof dome that can be opened.

            <h3>How are the yurts finished?</h3>

            <p>
              Each yurt is furnished with a queen-size bed with down quilt and
              gas-fired stove. Your luxury camping experience includes
              electricity and a sink with hot and cold running water. Shower and
              restroom facilities are located in the lodge.

            <h3>What should I bring?</h3>

            <p>
              Most guests pack comfortable walking shoes and plan to dress for
              changing weather with light layers of clothing. It's also helpful
              to bring a flashlight and a sense of adventure!
